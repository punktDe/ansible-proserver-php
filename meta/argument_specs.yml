    description:
      - Default variables that begin with `ansible_local` are populated
        using the PHP fact script (files/php.fact.py).
      - This scripts detects many PHP-related variables automatically
        depending on the system (e.g. PHP version, PHP-FPM service name,
        configuration, directories).
      - The fact script is copied to the target machine at the beginning
        of the role execution, even in `check_mode`.
      - Apart from `php.version` (on a Debian-based system), you probably
        shouldn't change the variables starting with `ansible_local`,
        unless you know what you're doing.

              - PHP version to be installed (in case of Debian-based systems) and configured
                on the target machine.
              - On FreeBSD Proserver-based systems, PHP is already pre-installed. The PHP version
                depends on the system Blueprint and is extracted automatically from the output
                of `php -v`. Hence, setting this variable is not required.
              - On Debian-based systems, this variable defaults to the newest possible version that
                can be installed using the APT package manager. Provided you've enabled the 3rd party
                APT repository using `php.repository.apt.enabled`, you can set this variable to the
                desired version of PHP, as long as it's actually available in the repositories.
                This can be checked by using `apt search --names-only php`.

                and `config: \"/usr/local/etc\"` on FreeBSD."
