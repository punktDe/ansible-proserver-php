    description:
      - Default variables that begin with `ansible_local` are populated
        using the PHP fact script (files/php.fact.py).
      - This scripts detects many PHP-related variables automatically
        depending on the system (e.g. PHP version, PHP-FPM service name,
        configuration, directories).
      - The fact script is copied to the target machine at the beginning
        of the role execution, even in `check_mode`.
      - Apart from `php.version` (on a Debian-based system), you probably
        shouldn't change the variables starting with `ansible_local`,
        unless you know what you're doing.

                and detected automatically; no manual setting needed.
              - On Debian-based systems, this option defaults to the latest version available from your system's repositories
              - However, if `php.repository.apt.enabled` is set to true, this can be set to any
                version of PHP available in the third-party repo.
              - To check which versions of PHP are available on your system, run `apt search --names-only php`
